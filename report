Multilingual Translation API with Snowflake and Flask
1. Project Overview
This project involves creating a backend API to manage multilingual translation data, utilizing Snowflake for data storage and Flask for API development. The system enables retrieval, insertion, and analysis of translation data.

2. System Architecture
Snowflake: Stores multilingual data in a multilingual_data table.
Flask API: Exposes endpoints to interact with the database.
Caching: Flask-Caching reduces query load on Snowflake.
Snowflake Table Schema:
sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE multilingual_data (
    TALK_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    NATIVE_LANG VARCHAR,
    TRANSCRIPT VARCHAR,
    SPEAKER_1 VARCHAR,
    RECORDED_DATE DATE,
    TITLE VARCHAR,
    VIEWS INT,
    DURATION INT
);
3. API Endpoints
GET /translations: Fetch translations based on the language parameter.
POST /translations: Insert new translation data into Snowflake.
GET /analytics: Retrieve analytics on frequently translated languages or high-usage periods.
4. Implementation Highlights
Caching: The GET /translations endpoint uses caching to improve performance.
SQL Queries: Optimized SQL queries for retrieving translations by language and analytics by period.
5. Optimization Techniques
Caching: Reduces frequent database access, improving response time.
SQL Indexing: Future improvements may include indexing on NATIVE_LANG and RECORDED_DATE for faster queries.
6. Steps to Run the Application
Install Dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Set up Snowflake Credentials:
Configure Snowflake connection in get_snowflake_connection().

Run Flask Server:
python app.py

Test API Endpoints using Postman or similar tools.

7. Conclusion
This API provides a scalable solution for managing multilingual translation data. Caching and query optimizations ensure efficient handling of large datasets.
